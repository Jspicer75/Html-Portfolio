<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’ve always loved puzzles, strategy and problem solving. Even as a child my favorite subject was Science.
   When I was younger, I always thought about working with computers when I grew up. I also loved taking things apart. 
   Every new toy that used electricity to work was taken apart and inspected. Soon, I started working on repairing and 
   modifying my bike and even moved on to go carts and minibikes. As an adult I entered the automotive industry and put
   my ambitions of entering the computer industry on the back burner. As time went by, I excelled at my career but still 
   found myself drawn to computer and information technologies. I realized how more and more the automotive industry and 
   the computer industry have started to intertwine. Software and computers are now a major part of even the simplest 
   automotive system as well as the repair industry. I’m excited to now finally have the chance to merge my two passions
   into one lifelong career.</p>
